## Testing

This project uses [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) to run both client-side (browser) and server-side (Node.js) tests.

### Project Structure

Tests are split into two environments:

- **Browser (jsdom)** — for React/browser environment tests.
- **Node.js** — for backend and server-only logic.

### File Naming Conventions

- Node-specific tests: `*.node.test.ts`
- Browser tests: any other `*.test.ts`, `*.test.tsx`, etc.

### Running Tests

Run **all tests**:

```bash
npm run test
```

## Local Development

### Clone and Install

```bash
git clone git@github.com:nomeyy/nomey-next.git
cd nomey-next
npm install
```

### Run Containers

You'll need to have `docker` installed locally. We advise running `./scripts/start-services.sh` to safely start your environment, but a normal docker workflow will also work.

### Run Next

```bash
npm run dev
```

> ⚠️ **Warning:** The T3 stack hard-enforces environment variables to provide type-safety. The project will not build without all environment variables in place. Contact a dev to get their variables to quickly get yourself up and running.
